/// It's not possible to generate random bytes from inside the wasm guest so the data is provided
/// by the wasm host which implies operating system specific details re: randomness.
///
/// The bytes are cryptographically random in that they are unpredictable, to the quality of what
/// host environment offers and the crypto implementation within holochain.
///
/// The bytes are not "secure" though:
///
/// - there's no way to prove that a specific value was the result of random generation or not
/// - the bytes are open in memory and even (de)serialized several times between the host and guest
///
/// The bytes are not a performant or testable way to do statistical analysis (e.g. monte carlo).
/// Rust provides several seedable PRNG implementations that are fast, repeatable and statistically
/// high quality even if not suitable for crypto applications. If you need to do anything with
/// statistics it is usually recommended to generate or provide a seed and then use an appropriate
/// PRNG from there.
